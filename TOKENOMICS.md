# Crypto Tea House: Tokenomics & Roadmap

## CTH Token Overview

The Crypto Tea House Token (CTH) is the native utility token that powers the entire Crypto Tea House ecosystem. It functions as both a governance token and the primary currency for the platform's prize pools and reward systems.

| Player Prize Pool | 50% | 50,000,000 CTH | Funds all direct winnings and jackpot payouts |

## Vesting Schedule

| Allocation | Amount | Vesting | Cliff |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Prize Pool | 40,000,000 CTH | Linear, 4 years | None |
| Community Treasury | 25,000,000 CTH | Linear, 5 years | 6 months |

## Tokenomics Mechanisms

### Deflationary Model
A portion of all prize pool fees is regularly burned, creating deflationary pressure on the token supply and potentially increasing value over time. The platform burns 5% of prize pool fees quarterly.

### Staking Mechanics
By staking CTH tokens, users earn passive yield and receive boosted odds in drawings. The staking APY adjusts based on total tokens staked, ensuring fair returns.

### Governance Structure
CTH token holders can participate in governance decisions including prize pool allocations, feature development priority, and protocol upgrades through a DAO structure.

They'll be integrated with the platform in Q4 2025 and will be funded through the Virtuals Agent Eco Support allocation of the token distribution.

## Prize Pools

The yearly prize pool will launch in Q1 2026 with substantial SOL prizes. Users collect yearly tickets through daily and weekly draws. Prize amounts will scale with platform growth and community size.

## NFT Collections

The platform will feature NFT collections with unique Lucky Cat designs and different rarity tiers. Holding these NFTs will provide benefits like increased pull limits, exclusive rewards, and access to premium content.

This tokenomics and roadmap structure provides a sustainable economic model that balances user rewards with platform development needs.
